# Project 1: Socket Basics

This project is an implementation of the popular game [Wordle](https://wordlegame.org/).

## Common details

The host address is expected to be `("proj1.3700.network", 27993)`


## Server

Implemented in Python3. Is meant to emulate the implementation of the game running on the Khoury Server.

Since the two components are communicating, they need to be on the same Docker network.

`docker run ` 

## Client
